# Abstract 

Background: Mortality rate estimation in small areas can be difficult due the low number of
events/exposure (i.e. stochastic error). If the death records are not completed, it adds a
systematic uncertainty on the mortality estimates. Previous studies in Brazil have combined
demographic and statistical methods to partially overcome these issues. We estimated age-
and sex-specific mortality rates for all 5,565 Brazilian municipalities in 2010 and forecasted
probabilistic mortality rates and life expectancy between 2010 and 2030. Methods: We used
a combination of the Tool for Projecting Age-Specific Rates Using Linear Splines (TOPALS),
Bayesian Model, Spatial Smoothing Model and ad-hoc procedure to estimate age- and sex-
specific mortality rates for all Brazilian municipalities for 2010. Then we adapted the Lee-
Carter model to forecast mortality rates by age and sex in all municipalities between 2010
and 2030. Results: The adjusted sex- and age-specific mortality rates for all Brazilian
municipalities in 2010 reveal a distinct regional pattern, showcasing a decrease in life
expectancy in less socioeconomically developed municipalities when compared to estimates
without adjustments. The forecasted mortality rates indicate varying regional improvements,
leading to a convergence in life expectancy at birth among small areas in Brazil.
Consequently, a reduction in the variability of age at death across Brazil’s municipalities was
observed, with a persistent sex differential, however. Conclusion: Mortality rates at a small-
area level were successfully estimated and forecasted, with associated uncertainty
estimates also generated for future life tables. Our approach could be applied across
countries with data quality issues to improve policy planning.
